HUMAN
Humans have a fairly robust physiology. Their internal makeup and reproductive processes are typical of most bipedal mammals, and their size
and their proportions give the appearance of being strong, fast and agile in comparison to the council races, Humans are roughly physically In or around peak physical condition Can overwhelm a similarly fit Turian, making them near equals in a hand-to-hand combat situation), and less agile than Asari (whom they resemble) though fit Human males are likely to be far stronger than the average Asari. Humans would appear on average to be stronger than Salarians but not as fast, due to he extremely elevated metabolisms of the latter. Like most organic races Humans are also capable of producing biotic individuals. All cases of biotics in Humans are the result of prenatal exposure to element Zero, witch carries a high risk of medical complications.

KROGAN
Due to the brutality of their surroundings, natural section has played a significant role in the evolution of the Krogan. Unlike most sentient species, Krogan eyes are wide-set giving them 240-degree vision. Their large shoulder humps store fluids and nutrients, enabling them to survive extended periods without food or water. A bigger shoulder hump is seen as a sign of high status. Their thick hides are virtually impervious to cuts, scrapes or contusions, and they are highly resistant to toxins, radiation and extreme heat and cold. Consequently their diets can include food and drink witch would prove dangerous to other species. Biotics are rare, though those who do possess the talent have strong abilities. The most amazing feature of Krogan biology is the multiple organs. Such as two hearts, four lungs Krogan also have a secondary nervous system using a neuro conductive fluid, meaning they are almost impossible to paralyze. Krogan can live well over a thousand years

SALARIAN
Salarians are bipedal race of amphibians, with tall, elongated bodies well suited for their high metabolism, and skeletons composed of more cartilage
Than those of other races. Salarian heads are long and thin, and have a pair of horns protruding from the top of their skulls. Salarians are noted for their high-speed metabolism, witch allows them to function on one hour of sleep a day. Their minds and bodies work faster than most sapient races. The drawback of this active metabolism is a short life span of around 40 years.

90% of the Salarian species is male.
Salarians do not possess the ability to use biotics

QUARIAN
Quarians are generally shorter and slightly smaller build than Humans. Quarians have a endoskeleton, they also have three fingers (thumb Index finger and a long finger),as well as three toes on each foot. Quarian facial features and hair are similar to Humans. Their lower legs are bowed backwards. Quarians have weak immune systems, they wear enviro-suits to protect them from disease or infection if they are injured. Their suits can be compartmentalized in the event of tear or breach to prevent the spread of contaminants. Along their suits Quarians have extensive cybernetic augmentations integrated into their bodies.

A Quarian who wishes to remove their suit must take antibiotics, immune-boosters, herbal supplements, or the like to do so safely and even then there are inherent risks. Quarians are given various vaccinations and immunizations to help ward off disease. However, they prefer the safety of their suits even in clean environments and are reluctant to remove them without a good reason.

Quarians do not possess the ability to use biotics

DRELL
Drell are a omnivorous race. Drell have denser muscle tissue than other races, giving them a wiry strength. Their skin is infused with a mild venom and may cause mild hallucinations on “oral contact”.

Drell possess a eidetic memory, an adaptation to a world where they must remember the location of every necessary resource of food and water across vast distances. The memories are so strong that an external stimulus can trigger a powerful memory recall. These recalls are so vivid and detailed that some Drell may mistake it for reality. The leading cause of death for Drell on Kahje is Keprals Syndrome, caused by cumulative long-term exposure to a humid climate. This syndrome erodes the ability of Drell lungs to take in oxygen, and eventually spreads out to other organs. And there is currently no known cure

ASARI
Asari pass through three climactic life stages, marked by biochemical and physiological changes:

The Maiden stage begins at puberty and is marked by the drive to explore and experience. Its not uncommon for many young Asari to dance at bars, slut

The Matron stage of life begins around the age of 350, though it can be triggered earlier if the individual melds frequently, whore. This period is marked by the desire to settle down and raise kids

The Matriarch stage begins around 700 years of age, or earlier if the individual melds rarely. Matriarchs become active in their community as sages and councilors, dispensing wisdom from centuries of experience. Matriarchs are rarely seen outside Asari space.

TURIAN
Since the Unification War, Turians normally wear elaborate tattoos marking their colony of origin. Most forms of life on Palaven has evolved some form of metallic “exoskeleton” to protect themselves from levels of radiation on Palaven. Turians have talons on their hands and feet, sharp enough to tear through flesh.

VOLUS
The Volus homeworld features an ammonia-based ecology and a gravitational field 1.5 times that of Earth, as well as a high-pressure atmosphere. The Volus are unable to survive in a unprotected in a atmosphere suitable for humans and other carbon based life forms, and wear protective capable of providing the proper atmosphere, as well as being pressurized to support the Volus. Traditional nitrogen/oxygen air mixtures are poisonous to them, and in low pressure atmospheres tolerable to most species, their flesh will split open.
As the Volus are never seen outside of their protective suits, little else is known about their appearance and physiology. It has been noted that Volus have cloacae, a trait they share with Salarians.

BATARIAN
Batarians exhibit a wide range of skin tones and colors. Most Batarians encountered by Shepard have a dark brown hue with pale facial ridges. General Batarian complexions include reddish-brown, greenish, yellow-greenish to yellow-brownish, light brown, and teal. 
Some Batarians possess striped colorations on their heads. Observed patterns include multiple chin stripes, a single strip running from the lower lip, or a thin dagger of color above the nose. These patterns are usually colored blue, black, or red, while the nose pattern is invariably red. At least one, Balak has what appears to be a black and yellow striped pigmentation at the temples with light green facial ridges. 

Batarians are an anthropoid race like Humans and Asari. Their faces are covered with short, fine hairs that grow longer and thicker around the mouth. A flat stripe of ridged cartilage runs along the tops of their skulls and down the backs of their necks. They have ears pointy at the upper end, though on occasion along the edges as well.

GETH
Part of the Geth’s success is due to their neural network. Effectively, they "share" their processing power, distributing low-level processes like motor control and visual identification to free up bandwidth for higher reasoning and complex thought.
Geth can’t share sensory data they aren’t a hive mind like the Rachni but in large groups they have more to think with. An individual Geth has only a basic intelligence on par with animal instincts, but in groups they can reason, analyze situations, and make tactical decisions as well as any of the organic races. An exception would appear to be Legion,
a Geth specifically designed to operate as an autonomous sentient unit outside the Perseus Veil. Legion possesses over 11 times as many Geth programs as a standard Geth platform and can function intellectually on its own.

Geth do not possess the ability to use biotics
